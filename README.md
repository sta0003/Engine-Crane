# EngineSimulatorSelector
An external app to help with changing engines within Engine Simulator

open to feedback


Install:
1. download the EngineSelector.exe from https://github.com/sta0003/EngineSimulatorSelector/releases/latest
2. place exe in root folder (engine-sim-build)
3. select an engine (Should pick up on all your engines)
4. press start simulator



How it works:
Engine Selector reads all folders in /engines as manufacturer names then all files in those sub folders as engines.

then searches inside the engine files for the function names and one start simulator is pressed updates main.mr
